## Hi There!

My name is Vivek Jagadeesh, and I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts.

My GitHub account houses a few notable projects
- vivekjag1/CS3733TeamO is the project repository for WPI CS3733 Software Engineering. It is a Node.js application for Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of writing, the website is publicly available at https://brighamwomens.com, and can be run by using the <code>yarn run dev</code> script in the project, and then navigating to https://localhost:3000
- portfolioWebsite is the repository for my portfolio website at https://vivekjagadeesh.com 

Again, all my projects are described thoroughly on my portfolio website at https://vivekjagadeesh.com

Due to WPI's academic integrity policy, I cannot share school projects publicly, but they are available upon request. Please email me at vivekjag1@gmail.com for such requests.
